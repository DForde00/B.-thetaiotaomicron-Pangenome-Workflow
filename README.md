# B.-thetaiotaomicron-Pangenome-Workflow
B. thetaiotaomicron Pangenome Workflow using Anvi'o with BUSCO as preliminary quality assessment.
This workflow requires pre-installed Anvi'o (https://anvio.org/) and BUSCO (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/busco) 
packages.

The code can be altered to construct a pangenome of a bacteria of the user's choice. To do so change the '--genera' 
and '-T' options on line 7.
